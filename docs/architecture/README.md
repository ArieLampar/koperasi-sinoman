## 🏗️ Architecture Principles

### Core Principles
1. **Modularity** - Clear separation of concerns across packages and applications
2. **Type Safety** - TypeScript throughout with strict typing
3. **Security First** - Built-in security at every layer
4. **Performance** - Optimized for Indonesian network conditions
5. **Scalability** - Designed to grow with cooperative membership
6. **Maintainability** - Clean code and comprehensive documentation

### Design Philosophy
- **Indonesian-First** - Built specifically for Indonesian cooperative needs
- **User-Centric** - Optimized for cooperative member experience
- **Compliance-Ready** - Regulatory compliance built-in from the start
- **Community-Driven** - Open source with community contributions

## 🔍 Quick Reference

### Key Components
- **Next.js Applications** - Server-side rendered React applications
- **Supabase Backend** - PostgreSQL database with real-time features
- **Shared Packages** - Reusable UI components and utilities
- **Vercel Deployment** - Edge-optimized hosting platform

### Integration Points
- **Authentication** - Supabase Auth with role-based access
